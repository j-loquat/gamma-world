## Overview

This project is a web application built with Python and FastAPI to generate characters for the 1st Edition Gamma World role-playing game. It implements the core rules for attribute generation, HP calculation, and mutation determination (both random and player-choice methods). Key features include a character generator UI, a browser for saved characters and creatures, and integration with Google Gemini AI to automatically generate character descriptions and images.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.12 or higher.
    *   `uv`: This project uses `uv` for running and managing dependencies. Install it by following the official instructions: [uv Installation Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
        *   *Windows PowerShell Example*: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
    cd Gamma-World # Or your repository directory name
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    *   `uv` automatically handles dependency installation when you run the application using `uv run`. No separate `pip install` step is typically needed if using `uv`.

4.  **Environment Variables**:
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.
    *   Add your Google AI Studio API key to the `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    *   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key. The AI features for description and image generation will not work without a valid key.

## Usage

To start the application server:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

This command uses `uv` to set up a virtual environment (if needed), install dependencies specified in `main.py`'s header comment, and run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn.

Once the server is running, access the application in your web browser at: `http://localhost:8000` (or the address provided in the terminal output).
