## Gamma World: The World of 2471

The year is **2471**. Forget the legends of the "Ancients" and their shining cities. The world you inhabit is a savage, mutated landscape, born from unimaginable destruction. Survival is a brutal, daily struggle against bizarre creatures changed by radiation and strange energies, treacherous environments warped by cataclysm, and the baffling, often deadly, remnants of a technology far beyond current understanding. This is your world, the Gamma World.

**The Fall of the Ancients:**

*   **The Golden Age (Early 24th Century):** Legends speak of a time when humanity, the "tool-making animal," achieved unparalleled mastery. Technology healed the ravaged Earth, conquered disease, and reached for the stars.
*   **The Decline (Late 23rd / Early 24th Century):** With basic survival conquered, society fractured. Ideological groups and "special interests" became fanatical, their debates turning to hatred and violence. Terrorism became a global plague.
*   **The Shadow Years (2309 - 2322):** This dark period began with bombings and assassinations between rival factions (like the "League of Free Men" and the "Autonomists"). Violence spiraled out of control, engulfing the world. Governments collapsed or secretly fueled the chaos.
*   **The Apocalypse & The Great Disaster (2322):** A mysterious group, "The Apocalypse," emerged, demanding an end to the madness. When ignored, they demonstrated horrific power, annihilating the capital city of every nation on April 17th. Weeks later, when the surviving factions united to attack The Apocalypse's hidden base, the group retaliated with world-shattering force. Oceans boiled, continents buckled, skies burned. Civilization was utterly destroyed.

**The Black Years & The New World:**

*   **Survival & Mutation:** Humanity endured, but the world was forever changed. The strange energies unleashed altered the very fabric of life. Nearly all living things, *including humans*, suffered mutations. Some gained physical alterations – extra limbs, carapaces, wings. Others, perhaps most significantly, developed latent *mental powers* (psionics), ranging from simple empathy to deadly force of will.
*   **Ecological Chaos:** The disaster and subsequent mutations shattered Earth's ecosystems. Many species vanished, others warped into monstrous forms. A vast, dangerous wilderness replaced civilization, inhabited by savage creatures struggling, like humanity, to survive.
*   **Ignorance & Superstition:** Records were lost, knowledge forgotten. The era of the Ancients became myth. Their ruined cities and installations are now often taboo "Death Lands," feared for unseen dangers like radiation and malfunctioning machines. The Ancients themselves are regarded with quasi-religious awe or terror. Their leftover technology – "Artifacts" – are objects of mystery, desire, and dread. Those who hold the tools, hold the power.

**Life Among the Ruins (The Present Day):**

Humanity clings to existence in scattered pockets across this dangerous world. Where you come from, and where you might travel, likely falls into one of these categories:

*   **Villages:** By far the most common settlements (50-500+ people). Technology is usually primitive (crossbows might be the ultimate weapon). Villagers are deeply suspicious of outsiders, often led by a shaman or chief who holds power through knowledge, charisma, or perhaps a functioning Artifact. Some villages might be secret bases for **Cryptic Alliances** (like the "Restorationists" studying nearby ruins while maintaining a low-tech facade). *This is a common origin for adventurers.*
*   **Tribes:** Semi-nomadic bands wandering in search of resources. They lack written language but possess strong oral traditions and survival skills adapted to the mutated wilderness. Governed by war and peace chiefs, tribes often form larger clans or "nations" for security. *Another possible origin.*
*   **Bands:** Smaller (<100 people), completely nomadic groups, constantly moving to survive. Warriors make up about a third of their number.
*   **Cities:** Very rare (5,000-50,000 inhabitants). The few that exist are usually found on coasts or major rivers, often near the scarce, functioning **Mech-Lands** (Robot Farms). Cities are melting pots of Pure Strain Humans, Humanoids, mutated animals, and even intelligent plants. *A potential origin, offering more interaction but perhaps greater dangers.*

**The Dangerous Landscape - Legacy of the Ancients:**

The world is littered with the remnants of the Ancients' civilization, places of great peril and potential reward:

*   **Ancient Areas ("Death Lands" / "Taboo"):** The general term for any ruins. Often irradiated and filled with unknown hazards.
*   **Mech-Lands (Robot Farms):** Automated agricultural complexes still producing canned food. Controlled by central computers and guarded by diverse robots (maintenance, security, farming). Accessing the food often requires bypassing security or finding proof of authorization. Many are claimed and guarded by local settlements or tribes.
*   **"Tombs of the Ancients":**
    *   *Ancient Buildings:* Structures tough enough to survive the cataclysm (military bases, research labs, earthquake-proof archives). May contain functioning security systems (electronic, robots, borgs - 25% chance of 1-4 defense/attack borgs in military sites), valuable records, or intact high-tech equipment. High risk, high reward.
    *   *Ancient Villages & Towns:* Usually picked clean of useful items long ago. Primarily offer temporary shelter.
    *   *Ancient Cities:* Desolate ruins often contaminated with dangerous levels of **hard radiation**. Entering is risky, but the chance of finding valuable Ancient devices is high.
    *   *Ancient Metropolises:* Vast expanses, mostly turned to radioactive slag. However, occasionally sections survived relatively intact. Braving the intense radiation here almost guarantees finding powerful Artifacts among the rubble.
*   **Fortifications:** Heavily protected complexes (military HQs, research stations, records centers) designed to resist attack. Can range from prominent buildings to vast underground bunkers. May be found in three states:
    *   *Depowered:* Security off, likely looted.
    *   *Active:* Security systems and robots still functioning on old programming, lacking intelligent direction.
    *   *Manned:* Active complex controlled by a surviving intelligence (Ancients, a Cryptic Alliance like the Restorationists, etc.). Contents depend on original function but are often well-preserved.
*   **Spaceports:** Primary targets during the destruction, usually located in zones of extreme devastation and radiation. Their robust construction means parts may have survived. Could contain complex equipment, aircraft, spacecraft, or even a legendary starship.

**Other World Features:**

*   **Radioactive Deserts:** Not natural deserts, but the result of high-yield fusion weapon impacts. Entering carries a daily risk of radiation poisoning (5% chance/day). These areas are taboo, sometimes used for banishment, but may hold the ruins of whatever the weapon targeted at their center. Beware radiation-resistant mutants.
*   **Transportation Networks:** Most roads and rails are gone. However, sections of the incredibly tough **duralloy** super-highway system (built for air-cushion vehicles) might remain. In the ruins of Metropolises, parts of the underground mass transit systems could also be in varying states of disrepair.

**The Struggle Continues:**

In 2471, humanity remains scattered and suspicious. **Cryptic Alliances** plot in the shadows, pursuing their own agendas – restoring the past, destroying technology, seeking genetic purity, or worshipping machines. The lost base of The Apocalypse remains a source of intense rumour and rival searches, believed to hold the ultimate power. Caution is paramount; a moment's lapse can mean instant, painful death.

You are one of the few with the courage or desperation to venture beyond the safety of your home. You are an explorer, a scavenger, a survivor. You are an adventurer in the Gamma World. What destiny will you carve out in this bizarre and dangerous age?

**Referee Notes:**

Player characters represent an elite with the desire, the initiative, and the ability to venture outside the boundaries of the village, town, or tribal lands. They are the pioneers, explorers, and tamers of the vast wilderness. It is they who will eventually bring order to the chaos of Gamma World and an end to the Black Years.
