  "description": "Felix moves with the disconcerting grace of a cat, but on a lithe, surprisingly durable humanoid frame. His fur, perhaps a patchwork of scars and resilient grey tabby, is thick and seems almost too tough, hinting at an unnaturally hardy constitution that shrugs off injuries. Keen, slitted pupils dominate a face that retains distinctly feline features â€“ sensitive whiskers that twitch constantly, sharp teeth visible in an occasional grin, and ears that swivel to catch the slightest sound in the Gamma World quiet. A tail, long and expressive, often betrays his inner state, swishing or lashing with unnerving speed. His build is wiry but strong, ready to unleash sudden, explosive bursts of movement.\n\nDespite possessing an intellect less suited to complex puzzles or ancient history, Felix compensates with sharp instincts and a strange, almost effortless magnetism. He carries himself with an easy confidence that draws attention, making him a natural, if perhaps simple-minded, focus of any group (CH 13). His physical prowess is undeniable; his reflexes are blindingly fast, his movements a blur when he's truly motivated. In combat, this translates to a terrifying ability to strike twice as often as others, a whirlwind of claws and blows. His senses are acute, particularly his taste; he has an odd habit of quickly touching his tongue to anything unfamiliar he intends to eat or handle, instantly discerning its edibility or detecting latent poisons.\n\nThe most unsettling aspect of Felix, however, is the subtle, disturbing energy that surrounds him. Drawing upon a quiet mental fortitude, he possesses the chilling ability to drain the very life force from intelligent beings nearby. When this power is active, a palpable, draining aura seems to emanate from him, weakening others while visibly, unnervingly, knitting his own wounds and revitalizing him. This parasitic healing, combined with his natural resilience and ability to regenerate even from grievous injuries, makes him a profoundly difficult opponent to put down. In the brutal landscape of 2471, Felix is a survivor built for speed, tenacity, and a predatory knack for turning the vitality of others into his own continued existence."
